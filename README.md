## Data: Project Tycho

Generate visualizations for exploring the epidemiological data from Project Tycho [VPGJ+13]  
• Download data from Tycho: https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/data/level1.php  
• Read the paper [VPGJ+1] to understand what information is included in the dataset. Skim the paper [MSvPF14] to get an idea about what could be interesting to show.  
• Potential task: Design and implement a visualization system for users to explore the dataset. You may conduct a pilot user study to understand whether your design works or not.
